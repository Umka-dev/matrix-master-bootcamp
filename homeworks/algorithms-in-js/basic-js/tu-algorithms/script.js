// 1. Addition
// Add all the values between 200 and 2700 (inclusively) that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both 3 and 5. To solve this task you might want to use the modulus operator.

//My Solution:

// 2. Shift the Values

// Given any array X, for example [2,1,6,4,-7], create an algorithm that shifts each number by one to the front. When your program is done the output for array [2,1,6,4,-7] should be [-7,4,6,1,2].

// 3. FizzBuzz

// Create an algorithm that inserts the numbers from 1 to 135 into an array, while replacing the values that are divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz", the numbers that are divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", and the numbers that are divisible with 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz".

// Your output should look like [1,2, 'Fizz',4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz',7, 8, ...]

// 4. Fibonacci

// For a Fibonacci sequence starting at 0 and 1 add up all the values below 1,000,000.

// A Fibonacci sequence is an infinite series of numbers that is created by adding the last two numbers in the series. A series would start with the numbers 0 and 1 in place, followed by 1 (0+1), 2 (1+1), 3 (1+2), 5 (3+2), etc.

// 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...

// 5. Remove the Negative

// Given any array X, for example [1,-2,4,1], remove the negative numbers, so that the output becomes: [1,4,1].

// 6. Communist Censorship

// Given the array of strings X = ['Man', 'I','Love','The','Matrix','Program'], replace every letter of the word Program with *, so the output would be ['Man', 'I','Love','The','Matrix','*******']. Then make your algorithm work for any word of your choice
