// Firday: 3rd Highest Number in Array
// Having an array of numbers, write an algorithm that will return the 3rd highest number in the array. Your algorithm should do only one iteration of the array (just one for/while loop).
// Example:
// //Using the array
// const arr = [5, 2, 8, 20, -2, 0, 11, 7, 3, 9, 31]
// //The correct answer is : 11

// My solution:

//Using the array
const arr = [5, 2, 8, 20, -2, 0, 11, 7, 3, 9, 31];
